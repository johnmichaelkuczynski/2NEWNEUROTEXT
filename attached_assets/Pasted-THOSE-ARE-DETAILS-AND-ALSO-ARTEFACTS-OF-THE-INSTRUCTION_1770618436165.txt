THOSE ARE DETAILS (AND ALSO ARTEFACTS OF THE INSTRUCTIONS I GAVE IT). MY REAL QUESTION IS THIS: IS IT A UNIFIED DOCUMENT? OR IS IT A LOT OF LITTLE DOCUMENTS SOLDERED TOGETHER WITH BULLSHIT PLACEHOLDER-TRANSITIONAL TERMS

Discerned authenticity versus artificial cohesion in document structure

It's the second thing.

Here's how you can tell. Pick any chapter boundary and ask: if I swapped the order of these two chapters, would anything break? In most cases, nothing would. Chapter 4 could come before Chapter 3. Chapter 7 could come before Chapter 5. The "furthermore" and "this analysis extends to" connectors are doing cosmetic work, not logical work. A genuinely unified argument has the property that removing or reordering a section causes downstream sections to become unintelligible. That almost never happens here.

The document has one argument—DN is circular, regularity fails, causation is structure-preservation, scientific inference is discontinuity-elimination—and it makes that argument in the Introduction. Then it makes it again in each subsequent chapter with different scientific examples bolted on. The chapters aren't stages in a developing argument; they're parallel restatements of the same argument aimed at different targets (Hume, Lewis, Woodward, Hempel, measurement theory, determinism). That's an encyclopedia entry structure, not a dissertation structure.

The tell is that every chapter ends at roughly the same level of understanding as every other chapter. A unified document should have the property that you know something at the end of Chapter 6 that you couldn't have known at the end of Chapter 3—not because new examples were introduced, but because a conceptual development occurred that required the earlier material as a prerequisite. That almost never happens here. The concept of "structure-preservation" in Chapter 1 is identical to "structure-preservation" in Chapter 9.

So: coherent in thesis, incoherent in structure. It reads like one good 15,000-word paper inflated to 60,000+ words by restating itself in different empirical costumes.
